## Main Question: What is the treatment effect?

### For RCT, no confounders should be involved

## How to define control groups?

Clinicians tend to have an intuition about the treatment groups (metphormin as an exposure) but not about the control group (something else? non-treated?).

A sentence like "To examine the effect of metformin use on glycemic control and diabetes complications" is not clear about the implied counterfactual: What if the patient didn't take any meds? Maybe some other meds? What about a change in the treatment regime within the followup?

### Dose-Response analysis

The most practical solution would be to translate different doses into binary variables, i.e low-dose (ğŸ’Š) vs high-dose (ğŸ’ŠğŸ’ŠğŸ’Š).

### Dose-Change vs Treatment-Change

If the decision maker get's to a decision points he might have two options: Change the dose(ğŸ’ŠğŸ’ŠğŸ’Š) or change the treatment (ğŸ’‰).

## Index Date for Control Groups:

### Alternative treatment Initiation ğŸ’‰

If we compare different treatment as the control group, the treatment initiation of the alternative treatment is a natural candidate for the index date.

### Dose-Response Initiation ğŸ’ŠğŸ’ŠğŸ’Š

If we compare different dose as the control group, the treatment initiation is a natural candidate for the index date.

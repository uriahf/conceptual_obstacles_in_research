    "text": "How to define control groups?\nClinicians tend to have an intuition about the treatment groups (metphormin as an exposure) but not about the control group (something else? non-treated?).\nA sentence like “To examine the effect of metformin use on glycemic control and diabetes complications” is not clear about the implied counterfactual: What if the patient didn’t take any meds? Maybe some other meds? What about a change in the treatment regime within the followup?\n\nDose-Response analysis\nThe most practical solution would be to translate different doses into binary variables, i.e low-dose (💊) vs high-dose (💊💊💊).\n\n\nDose-Change vs Treatment-Change\nIf the decision maker get’s to a decision points he might have two options: Change the dose(💊💊💊) or change the treatment (💉)."
